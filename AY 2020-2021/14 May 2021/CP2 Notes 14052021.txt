Today's Lesson will be about Javascript
We shall focus on Drag and Drop behaviours

This week is a special arrangement because the exercises will not be defended. Submission is only online until 2359 tonight. Only for this week.

This happens next week 
beginning next week we shall resume with the regular sessions
Tuesday lessons - come to class to attend the lesson and for questions. 
Thursday laboratory defenses. - come to class to work on the exercises. In-person setup: they dont need to defend it because they have worked at their exercises here in the lab. 
Online: they still need to defend their exercises. 

Some major announcements:
14 June is the final exam (for those who will not pass by colloquia)
27 May presentation of the homework 2 (project)
25 May midterm exam 2

ideally the setup will be in online hybrid mode. 
special arrangements and considerations will be given to those who will show up in person. 

people who will show up in person get to present their homeworks and do their midterm exams while here in famnit. their setups will be more relaxed. 

people who will do their exams online will be under stricter conditions. 

will they do the same exam? well yes! 

in person: you are encouraged to bring your own personal device 

All codes and resources (even these text notes) will be uploaded in e-classroom and in github.
